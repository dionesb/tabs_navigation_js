            <h2>Component based</h2>
            <p>React makes creating interactive UIs an easy task. With it we can create simple views for each state in
              your application, and React will efficiently update and render only the necessary components as the data
              changes.br
            </p>
            <p>Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.</p>
            <p>We can create encapsulated components that manage their own state and then combine them to create complex
              UIs.</p>
            <p>As the component logic is written in JavaScript and not in templates, we can easily pass different types
              of data throughout your application and still maintain the state outside the DOM.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript untime</h2>
            <p>Node.js is open-source, cross-platform software and a JavaScript JavaScript runtime that executes
              JavaScript code at the backend and frontend level (depending only on the libraries and frameworks used for
              the same purpose).</p>
            <p>Node.js has the NPM reusable package manager (Node Package Manager), the largest software repository,
              giving the interpreter a potential to be used in any situation. The most popular package is Express.js, a
              complete framework for developing Web applications.

            <h2>Structured interpreted programming language</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a structured interpreted programming language, high-level script
              with weak dynamic typing and multiparadigm (prototypes, object-oriented, imperative and, functional).
              Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main technologies on the World Wide Web.
              JavaScript allows interactive web pages and is therefore an essential part of web applications. The vast
              majority of websites use it, and all major browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to run it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is currently the main language for client-side programming in web browsers. It is also widely used on
              the server side through environments such as node.js.

            <h2>Hypertext Markup Language</h2>
            <p>HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language, version 5) is a markup language for the World Wide Web and is a key
              Internet technology, originally proposed by Opera Software. It is the fifth version of the HTML language.
              This new version brings with it important changes regarding the role of HTML in the world of the Web,
              through new features like semantics and accessibility. Enables the use of new resources previously
              possible only with the application of other technologies. Its essence has been to improve the language
              with support for the latest multimedia,
              while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and other devices
              (browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 will be the new standard for HTML, XHTML, and HTML DOM. Currently, it is
              in the draft phase, but several browsers already implement some of its features.

            <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (or simply CSS)</h2>
            <p>CSS3 is the third newest version of the famous Cascading Style Sheets (or simply CSS), by which styles
              are defined for a web project (internet page). With transition effects, image, background image and
              others, you can create unique styles for your web projects, changing different aspects of design in the
              page layout.</p>
